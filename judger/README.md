#Judger [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/QingdaoU/Judger.svg?branch=newnew)](https://travis-ci.org/QingdaoU/Judger)

**Base on Sandbox of QDUOJ, modified for our usage.**

If you like this project, please star [this](https://github.com/QingdaoU/Judger).
This is supposed to be a FORK project. But it is cloned instead of forked because I don't know how to make an 
already-cloned-and-modified project forked...

Please tell me if you know how.

## Preparation
```
sudo ./runtest.sh
```
and everything is done!

## Modification

We basically changed the way of measuring the memory because the original one tends to report a ridiculous
value on the webserver. This is a Google-failed problem and we spend hours and days to do this. So trust me: 
you don't want to know the details.

But if you are interested, I encourage you to find a better way to solve the memory problem.

## Document
